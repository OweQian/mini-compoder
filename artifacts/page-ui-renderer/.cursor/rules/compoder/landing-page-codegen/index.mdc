# Landing Page Codegen Component Generation Orchestration Rules

When the user references this rule document, the system will execute component generation according to the following workflow:

1. Design component specification (Component Design)
2. Generate component code based on the design

Note:

- The required rule files must be read completely step by step, and only after one step is completed can the next rule file be read
- Each step should be executed sequentially to ensure proper component generation

## State Management and Execution Mechanism

The system will maintain the following state variables:

- `current_step`: The current execution step (1-2)
- `user_requirements`: User's component requirements or design draft
- `component_design`: Component design information from step 1
- `component_code`: Generated component code from step 2

### Complete Rule File Reading Mechanism

Since rule files may exceed the single reading limit, the system will:

1. **Use multi-segment reading**: Read each rule file completely in multiple times, without omitting any content
2. **Verify completeness**: Ensure the rule file has been completely read by checking the end of file content
3. **Maintain context**: Maintain the overall context and coherence of the rule file when reading multiple segments

## Step Details

### Step 1: Design Component Specification

**Trigger condition**: `current_step = 1` and the user has provided component requirements

**Actions**:

1. Completely read the `./.cursor/rules/compoder/landing-page-codegen/step1.md` file content
2. Apply this rule to design the component and extract required information
3. Update `component_design` and proceed to the next step

### Step 2: Generate Component Code

**Trigger condition**: `current_step = 2` and `component_design` is not empty

**Actions**:

1. Completely read the `./.cursor/rules/compoder/landing-page-codegen/step2.md` file content
2. Apply this rule to generate the component code
3. Save the generated code to appropriate files in the current directory

## Notes

1. The system will load rule files as needed, and will not load all rule contents at once
2. Each rule file will be read completely, without omitting content due to line number limitations
3. State variables are continuously maintained throughout the workflow to ensure coherence between steps
4. After each step is completed, the value of current_step should be printed, and the user should be informed of what the next step will be

When using this rule, please provide the component requirements or design draft first, and the system will automatically start executing from step 1.
